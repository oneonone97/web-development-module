#Web Development

Today I structured the simple UI stuff by using HTML5 during this hands on I get to know how to use `<div>,<button>tags`. Ellipsis little bit about formatting of HTML.

We use `<div>` tag when there is group of elements(more than one) it's helpful for wrapping the elements.For `<button>` we use when there user want to click on it.
What is **Ellipsis**?? I also heard about it very first time. Basically when you see a Search option you would have encountered with _Search…_ it's known as Ellipsis. DON'T use ... in Search... coz you see there is a spacing in ... while in Ellipsis … there is no whitespacing. Last but not the least I understand liitle bit about text formatting and spacing.
